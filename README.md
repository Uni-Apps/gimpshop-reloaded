GIMPshop Reloaded
======
###Introduction
GIMPshop was a modification of the free and open source graphics program GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), with the intent to replicate the feel of Adobe Photoshop. 
Its primary purpose was to make users of Photoshop feel comfortable using GIMP (en.wikipedia.org)

GIMPshop Reloaded is an original GIMPshop remake, made by someone who had been using Photoshop for seven years! 
GIMPshop Reloaded has an interface similiar to Adobe's product, shortcuts, plugin and much more, everything you need to have a real Photoshop feel.

Soon I will release a portable version of GIMPShop preconfigured :).
